### Scraping the Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator (SRRI) from Key Information Documents (KIDs)

In each document, a scale ranging from 1 to 7 is (usually) located on the first page. 

The Repository contains:

* A sample of 121 KIDs 
* A code directory including a package that contains functions which extract the SRRI given a .pdf document as well as the HEX code of the shading
* A seperate [test file](https://github.com/Base-R-Best-R/KID/blob/main/Code/Tests/Test_ext_Function.pdf) that displays the current performance of the code given the sample mentioned above
* The current state of my [bachelor thesis](https://github.com/Base-R-Best-R/KID/blob/main/Bachelor%20Thesis%20(Statistics)/Bachelor_Thesis_KIDs.pdf) in statistics
