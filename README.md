### Scraping the Synthetic Risk and Reward Indicator (SRRI) from Key Information Documents (KIDs)

In each document, a scale ranging from 1 to 7 is (usually) located on the first page. 

The Repository contains:

* A sample of 121 KIDs 
* A code directory including a package that contains functions which extract the SRRI given a .pdf document as well as the HEX code of the shading
* A seperate testing file that displays the current performance of the code given the sample mentioned above
